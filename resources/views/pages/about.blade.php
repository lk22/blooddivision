				<h1><strong>ABOUT BLOOD DIVISION.</strong></h1>
				<h3><strong>T</strong>he division has existed in several years but had its inactivity periods here and there.
				<h3><strong>I</strong>t all started when the founders was in a Greece guild while playing Warhammer Age Of reckoning, the guild seemed to have some issues that wasnt satisfied for the founders of blood.
				</h3>
				<h3>So they decided to start they're own project called Blood</h3>
				<h3>Blood was started to only be available for danish gamers, and was a clan that mostly played MMO Games like SWTOR(Star Wars The Old Republic) and WOW (World Of Warcraft)</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>After the discovery of the games Destiny, Halo5, Tom Clancy's The Division, the founders came up with an upgrade to they're clan name Blood Division. </h3>
				<h3><strong>T</strong>he division has existed in several years but had its ups and downs, the division started back to the beginning of Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning as a strong, and huge danish guild.</h3>
				<h3>Now the guild is back stronger and bigger than never and allways searching for more memberships. </h3>
				<h3>That are ready to fight Big battles with other danes and scandinavians</h3>
